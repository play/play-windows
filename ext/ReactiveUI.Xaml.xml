            IReactiveCommand is an Rx-enabled version of ICommand that is also an
            Observable. Its Observable fires once for each invocation of
            ICommand.Execute and its value is the CommandParameter that was
            provided.

             User Errors are similar to Exceptions, except that they are intended
             to be displayed to the user. As such, your error messages should be
             phrased in a friendly way. When a UserError is thrown, code higher up
             in the stack has a chance to resolve the UserError via a user
             interaction. 
            
             Code can also add "Recovery Options" which resolve user errors: for
             example an "Out of Disk Space" error might have an "Open Explorer"
             recovery option.
